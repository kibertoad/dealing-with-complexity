Source code for the "Dealing with Complexity" workshop

## Instructions

Use handler implementation in `src/init.js` (starting with line 37) as a basis for a new, layered implementation,
spread across `controllers`, `repositories`, `services` and `validators` folders.

You can start by moving fragments of code from `src/init.js` into `controllers/usersController.js`

## Running code

1. Install Node.js;
2. Run `npm install`;
3. Do code changes;
4. Run `npm run test`;
5. After all code changes are done correctly, all tests should be passing.
